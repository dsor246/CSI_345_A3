Web design made by 3rd Year Compsci students in the domain of file sharing.

The design incorporated several aspects of interaction design and UX such as usability, usefulness, emotional impact and meaningful interactions. The scenario given was a group of students collaborating on a big project, for which each is assigned their own parts. The project consists of a Webpage design, documentation and a report evaluating their design choices. However, there are problems that the students are facing which are:

*Some are not familiar with the domain of file sharing
*Deadline for the project is due in a week

These problems encountered by our users must be met by addressing efficiency and ease of learning for the file sharing website. These were addressed by Usage testing through conceptualization, visualization and evaluation of the scenario.
